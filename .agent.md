Next conversation - bring up the following idea that i want to review:

A complete overhaul of DSPies.

In order to make an interactive demo so that people "get" the basic concepts. I am thinknig of something
where there are a number of talking heads or characters in a circle arguing.

Maybe some animals sitting behind the computer and arguing over how to prompt

Idea:
Animal in the chair (cat): I have just enough tokens left for one prompt. I can't waste it!
Elephant standing behind: Then why does your prompt look like this? It's so lazy and it won't work. Use JSON to format it!
Aligator standing next to the elephant: That's just Twitter talk - you need to threaten the LLM to make it work.
Duck standing next to aligator: Guys guys don't sweat it, you just need to make sure you tell it the input and output format

Cat in the chair: Quiet! I'm going to try DSPy.
The 3 animals standing behind him: DSPy?

(Cut to the start of the demo)
